**SHARK ATTACK DATA ANALYSIS**

**Abstract**

This project reveals the shark attacks over a given period of time. It shows the rate of attack. The analysis also gives interesting details of the most attacked body part by these sharks, while showing too the time of the day shark attack is most prevalent. Particularly, this analysis gives a very lucid details on the areas where shark attack occurs.
Significantly, my analysis was able to tell the most common type of shark species and the yearly trend of the shark attacks. 

**Introduction**

Sharks are fishes. Like other fishes, sharks are cooled-blooded. They have fins, live in water and breath with their gills like other fishes do. The skeleton is made up of cartilage. The shark fusiform body shape reduces drag and requires minimum energy to swim.

**Problem Statement**

Through this analysis we can see how dangerous these attacks by the sharks can be. The analysis shows the hours of the day when most of the attack happen, making it easy to predict the attack and possibly avoid been attacked.

**Steps Followed**

1.	Load the data in Power BI Desktop dataset in a CSV file format.
2.	Open power query editor and in view tab under Data preview section check; ‘column distribution’, ‘column quality’ and ‘column profile’ options.
3.	So much data cleaning was done to make the data good enough for analysis
4.	Text analysis was done to be able to get the most attacked body part
5.	Data Transformation and modelling.
6.	I made use of conditional column to extract the week day name and month name.
7.	Calculations using DAX functions.
8.	Preparation of visualization canvas and customizing.
9.	Addition of visual cards and chats to the canvas.
10.	Addition of visual filter (slicers) were added to the canvas.
